Objective 
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with 
what we've already learned about loops. Check out the Tutorial tab for 
learning materials and an instructional video! 

Task 
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from o to N - 1, print 
its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings 
on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail). 



Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases). 
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contain a String, .

Constraints

Output Format

For each String S (where ), print 's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by 's odd-indexed characters.

Sample Input

2
Hacker
Rank
Sample Output

Hce akr
Rn ak
Explanation

Test Case 0:  S = "Hacker"
S[0] = "H"
S[1] = "a"
S[2] = "c"
S[3] = "k"
S[4] = "e"
S[5] = "r"
 
The even indices are H, c, and e, and the odd indices are a, k, and r. 
We then print a single line of 2 space-separated strings; the first 
string contains the ordered characters from S's even indices (Hce), and 
the second string contains the ordered characters from S's odd indices 
(akr). 

Test Case 1:  S = "Rank"
S[] = ""
S[] = ""
S[] = ""
S[] = ""
 
The even indices are 0 and 2, and the odd indices are 1 and 3. We then 
print a single line of 2 space-separated strings; the first string 
contains the ordered characters from S's even indices (Rn), and the 
second string contains the ordered characters from S's odd indices (ak).
