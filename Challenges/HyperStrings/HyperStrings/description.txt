String A is called a Super String if and only if:

A contains only letters a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i;
For any i and j, A[i] has lower ascii code than A[j], where
0 <= i < j <= legth(A) 
Given a set of Super Strings H, a Hyper String is a string that can 
be constructed by concatenation of some Super Strings of the set H. 
We can use each Super String as many times as we want.

Given set H, you have to compute the number of Hyper Strings with length no greater than M.

Input-Format:
first line contains 2 integers N = number of Super string in H; and M = length of the Hyper string.

Constraints:
1 < N < 100 ; the count of Super Strings in H
1 < M < 100 ; length of Hhper string

output-format:
Output an integer which is the number of possible Hyper Strings that can 
be derived. Since it may not fit in bit integer, print the output module 
. (i.e. answer = answer % )
